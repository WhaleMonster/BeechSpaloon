## Marvel Character Encyclopedia

Starting in 1939 as Timely Publications, Marvel Comics has become one of the two-headed dragons of the comic book publishing age. Owning almost 34% shares of all comic book revenue, with DC at 30%, Marvel has been a household name for quite some time. With over 75 years of publication history, it seems quite easy to lose track of every character that was drawn and characterized. This app aims to solve that issue.
